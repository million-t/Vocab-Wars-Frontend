Welcome to Vocab Wars, the Wordle Contest Platform! This platform allows users to create and participate in Wordle contests. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## 🌟 Inspirations 🌟

The idea for Vocab Wars is inspired by both the popular [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game and the competitive programming platform [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). It combines the fun of word puzzles with the competitive spirit of coding contests.
